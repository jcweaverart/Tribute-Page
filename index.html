                                    <p>When David Berenbaum's spec script first emerged in 1993, Carrey was pre-Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and attached to front the Christmas film.

                                    <p>And his A Night at the Roxbury co-star Chris Kattan was his elf. This was back when the pair were pre-Saturday Night Live, and part of the comedy troupe <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/60421/21-things-you-might-not-know-about-elf"> ...Read More </a></p>

                                    <h3>Director Jon Favreau Favored Practical Effects</h3>
                                    <p>Inspired by the Christmas specials he grew up with, Favreau explained in the film's commentary track that he employed “old techniques” instead of CGI <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/60421/21-things-you-might-not-know-about-elf"> ...Read More </a></p>

                                    <p>Some effects just couldn't be practical. These included the snowflakes that drift over the opening credits, and many of the snowballs in Buddy's<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/60421/21-things-you-might-not-know-about-elf"> ...Read More </a></p>

                                    <p>Peter Billingsley, who memorably played the Red Ryder-wanting Ralphie in the 1983 holiday classic, popped in to play Ming the elf.

                                    <p>As a writer/director/actor, Favreau has often appeared in his own films. He fronted Made with friend Vince Vaughn, and later found a sweet supporting role for himself in Iron Man.<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/60421/21-things-you-might-not-know-about-elf"> ...Read More </a></p>

                                    <p>To play the bubbly baby version of the titular elf, Favreau had initially cast twin boys whose blonde curly hair made them great little doubles for the mop-topped Ferrell.

                                    <p>In first drafts of Berenbaum's Elf script, Buddy's decision to seek out his dad was in part because he was being hassled by the actual elves for being different. Favreau pushed to take out this element. <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/60421/21-things-you-might-not-know-about-elf"> ...Read More </a></p>
